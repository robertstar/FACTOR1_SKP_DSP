2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[0]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[0]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[0]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[1]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[2]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[2]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[2]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[3]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[3]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[3]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[4]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[4]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[4]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[5]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[5]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[5]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[6]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[6]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[6]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net tx_temp_reg[7]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin tx_temp_reg[7]_LDC_i_1/O, cell tx_temp_reg[7]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port PHY_MDIO expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
5 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are mac_inst/fifo_arp_inst/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/gwss.wsts/ram_afull_fb, mac_inst/fifo_arp_inst/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/gwss.wsts/ram_afull_i, rs485_dfs_inst/fifo_rx/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.rd/gras.rsts/ram_empty_i, mac_inst/fifo_26010/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/gwas.wsts/ram_full_i, mac_inst/fifo_26100/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.wr/gwas.wsts/ram_full_i.
